# BankingWebsite
I have coded this website using css,js and html. Me and my friends have coded this very simple website.

In our website I may have added a few code from the internet but otherwise the rest of the coding is done by using our won logic //I wanted to write this honestly here

In order to use our website make sure you change the filenames path on login.html,temp.html etc.

temp.html stands for the withdraw and deposit page. //sorry for the ugly filename as I am right now too lazy to commit those changes and promise to use better filenames in the future.

We have added external css and js files in all our html pages as we didnt want to make our code look ugly. //also external files have many advantages bu I am too lazy to type them here now!

Also I should have just created a zip file instead of uploading individual files. But well whats done is done. Good thing I am not writing this readme article for a company otherwise my boss would have whooped my a**.

Yeah thats pretty much it for this project!
